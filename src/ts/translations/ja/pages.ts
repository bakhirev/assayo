§ page.team.total.description1: *Person-days* — the work of one employee during a single working day. For example, in one calendar day, a team of three employees produces a work volume of three person-days.
§ page.team.total.description2: *Absentee days* are counted only as working days when commits could have been made. Weekends, public holidays, and vacations are not included in the calculation.
§ page.team.total.description3: The *working and dismissed* card shows the actual composition of employees who are continuously involved in work. Additionally, there are "assistants" — typically employees of a different specialization who may occasionally make commits to the project.
§ page.team.total.description4: *Overpayment* includes only working days when commits could have been made. Weekends, public holidays, and vacations are not included in the calculation. This is why overpayment + actual cost != total. The total cost includes payment for weekends, public holidays, and vacations.
§ page.team.total.description5: *Weekend work* is calculated at a rate of x2 the payment of a regular day. The displayed amount is specifically the overpayment (x1), as the fact of overtime in this context is not of interest. We focus on overpayment when increasing work speed.

§ page.team.pr.description1: *Development time* is the time difference from the first to the last commit on a task. It does not matter if there were breaks of several days between commits or not. Any commit increases the time.
§ page.team.pr.description2: *Waiting time* is the time between the last commit and the code merge. It shows the actual downtime while waiting for something.
§ page.team.pr.description3: *Task creation date* in the task tracker is calculated by its sequential number and the minimum date of any next Issue in the code. The method has a margin of error and, as a rule, the tasks turn out to be older. Frequent releases, fast bugfixes, and a large number of employees working on the code reduce this margin of error.
